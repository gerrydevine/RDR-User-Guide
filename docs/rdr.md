## Introduction

The Research Data Repository (RDR) allows you, as a researcher at Macquarie University, to upload your research data and make it publicly available. In doing so, The RDR promotes collaboration, data sharing and discovery amongst researchers globally according to <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">FAIR</a> data principles. 

This User Guide will walk you through the main tenants of the RDR and guide you in sharing your research data with the wider community.

## Logging into the RDR

Research staff at Macquarie (including HDR students) can automatically access the RDR using their MQ OneID credentials.

To log in:

1. Visit the RDR home page at [**https://figshare.mq.edu.au**](https://figshare.mq.edu.au){:target="\_blank"}
2. Click on __Log in__ on the top right of the page

      </a>
    </p>

3. Enter your Macquarie University OneID credentials. Once you have entered these, you will need to then further authenticate with 2FA credentials (typically using an authenticator app on your mobile phone device):

    <aside class="callout">
      <b> Note </b>
      If this is your first time logging into the RDR you will need to set up your two-factor authentication. Follow the instructions given to do so.

    </p>

5. You can return to this home page (or 'My data' page) at any time by clicking __My data__ on the top right corner of the page.

## Projects

Projects are a key feature of the RDR and are a way to put your uploaded datasets into context with the actual research that produced them. Research project information is synchronised from Macquarie University's [Research Management System (Pure)](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/) into the RDR, and thus allows you to upload and organise datasets under the umbrella of the research project in which it was created. In addition, any collaborators on the project are also invited to collaborate with you on uploading and publishing datasets into the RDR under that project.         

help you organise your data within the RDR as well as collaborate with your project. Projects in the RDR map directly to actual research projects being undertaken at Macquarie University.

## Uploading a Dataset

1. Click on the __My data__ link on the top right of the screen, then click on the __Projects__ tab to navigate to your list of projects

    <img width="800" style="border: 1px solid;" src="/User-Guides/assets/images/rdr/projects_tab.png">
  </a>
</p>

2. Select the project under which you'd like to upload the dataset. On the resulting Project page, click on __Add a new item__ which will load the dataset upload form.

    <img width="800" style="border: 1px solid;" src="/User-Guides/assets/images/rdr/data_upload_form.png">
  </a>
</p>

3.  Upload your dataset by either dragging the dataset file(s) from your local PC onto the data upload panel at the top of the form, or use the __browse__ link to select a file(s) from your local file system.

    <aside class="callout warning">
      <b> Note </b>
      It is important that your datasets are properly formatted for open data publication. To get further help in how to structure and save your data see the guide entitled <strong>Formatting Your Data for Publication</strong>.
    </aside>

4.  Fill out the metadata fields on the form (Title, Description, etc), remembering that your answers here determine the quality and discoverability of your data. You are encouraged to follow along with the guidelines in the appendix of this doucment for how to complete each section of the upload form.

5.  Save your document by clicking on the __Save Changes__ button at the bottom of the page. At this stage your dataset upload and associated metadata descriptions are saved under your chosen project. You can still continue to make further changes to your metadata or dataset uploads, remembering to save each time after making your edits.

6.  When you are happy that your dataset record is complete, and that the uploaded data and associated metadata fields are of a high quality, you can choose to now publish your dataset. To do so, tick the checkbox marked __Publish__ at the bottom of the form, then click on the __Publish item__ button to send your dataset forward for publication.

  <p align="center">

      <img width="800" style="border: 1px solid;" src="/User-Guides/assets/images/rdr/publish_item.png">
    </a>
  </p>

7. Your dataset has been sent forward for publication review by a member of the repository administration team. Upon successful publication you will receive a DOI for your published dataset that you can now use to publicly identify and cite your dataset. Should any issue arise with your dataset during review , a member of the repository team will be in touch with you.
