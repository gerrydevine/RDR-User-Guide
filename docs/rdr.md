4. Upload your dataset by either dragging the dataset file(s) from your local PC onto the data upload panel at the top of the form, or use the _'browse'_ link to select a file(s) from your local file system.

   > It is important that your datasets are properly formatted for open data publication. To get further help in how to structure and save your data see the guide entitled _"Formatting data for publication"_.

5. Fill out the metadata fields on the form (Title, Description, etc), remembering that your answers here determine the quality and discoverability of your data. You are encouraged to follow along with the guidelines in the appendix of this doucment for how to complete each section of the upload form.

6. Save your document by clicking on the _'Save Changes'_ button at the bottom of the page. At this stage your dataset upload and associated metadata descriptions are saved under your chosen project. You can still continue to make further changes to your metadata or dataset uploads, remembering to save each time after making your edits.

7. When you are happy that your dataset record is complete, and that the uploaded data and associated metadata fields are of a high quality, you can choose to now publish your dataset. To do so, tick the checkbox marked _'Publish'_ at the bottom of the form, then click on the _'Publish item'_ button to send your dataset forward for publication.

8. Your dataset has been sent forward for publication review by a member of the repository administration team. Upon successful publication you will receive a DOI for your published dataset that you can now use to publicly identify and cite your dataset. Should any issue arise with your dataset during review , a member of the repository team will be in touch with you.
